Robofriends is a fun way of displaying your personal or professional contacts. Each contact card includes their name, email, and phone and each contact is given a unique robot avatar created by the robohash API. There is also a snappy search feature that allows you to quickly type in a persons name to filter contacts.

Created using Create-react-app and bootstrapped with Tachyons. Used RoboHash API and JSONPlaceholder API for data and avatars. Final production build deployed on GitHub pages and compiled with Webpack and Babel.
